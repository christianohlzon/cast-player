Cast player that uses Chrome's built in cast tool. It let's you display subtitles when casting local files. The quality suffers a bit when using tab mirroring but to use regular media casting you would need to run a server to share your local files with your Chromecast.  

Supports HTML5 video formats and some .mkv file.

Supports .vtt and .srt
